The New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI) is pleased to announce it's sponsorship of a Software Carpentry instructor 
training event in New Zealand. 
  <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>
  and <a href="{{site.dc_site}}">Data Carpentry</a>'s mission is to
  help scientists and engineers get more research done in less time
  and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for scientific
  computing.  This hands-on two-day workshop covers the basics of
  educational psychology and instructional design, and looks at how to
  use these ideas in both intensive workshops and regular classes. The
  workshop is a mix of lectures and hands-on lessons where you practice
  giving a short lesson using approaches learned and implement some of
  the teaching techniques which we will discuss.  This is training for
  teaching, not technical training; you do not need any particular
  technical background, and we will not be teaching that. This workshop
  is based on the constantly revised and updated
 <a href="{{site.swc_githubio}}/instructor-training/">curriculum</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong> The course is aimed at everyone who is
  interested in becoming a better teacher. In particular, this training
  is aimed at those who want to become Software and Data Carpentry
  instructors, run workshops and contribute to the Carpentry training
  materials.  You don't currently have to be an instructor or a
  teacher to attend this workshop, but you do need to be willing and
  committed to becoming one and to improving your teaching techniques.

<p>
  <strong>Requirements:</strong> Participants should bring a laptop
  that is Internet connected and has a functioning browser.  If you
  have it, a device for recording audio and video (mobile phones and
  laptops are OK) is useful as throughout the two days, we are going to record
  one another teaching in pairs or threes.  It does not have to be
  high-quality, but it should be good enough that you can understand
  what someone is saying.

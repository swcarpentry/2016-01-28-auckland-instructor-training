<h2>Workshop description</h2>

<!--
  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>
The New Zealand eScience Infrastructure (NeSI) is pleased to announce it's sponsorship of a Software Carpentry instructor 
training event in New Zealand. 
This workshop covers the basics of educational psychology and instructional design, and looks at how to use these ideas 
in both intensive workshops and regular classes. The workshop is a mix of lectures and hand-on lessons where you 
practice giving a short lesson using approaches learned and implement some of the teaching techniques which we will discuss.
This is training for teaching, not technical training; you do not need any particular technical background, 
and we will not be teaching that.This workshop is based on the constantly revised and updated
 <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/">curriculum</a>.
</p>


<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  The course is aimed at everyone who is interested in becoming a better teacher. In particular,
  this trainig is aimed at those who want to become Software and Data Carpentry instructors, run
  workshops and contribute to the Carpentry training materials.
<p><strong>You don't have to be currently an instructor or a teacher to attend this workshop. But you do need to be
 willing and committed to become one and to improve your teaching techniques. </strong></p>
</p>

  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS

  Modify the block below if there are any special requirements.
-->
<p>
  <strong>Requirements:</strong> 
  Participants should bring a laptop that is wifi Internet capable and has a functioning browser. 
  If you have it, a specialized device for recording audio and video 
  (mobile phones and laptops are OK) - throughout the two days, 
  we are going to record one another teaching in pairs or threes. 
  It does not have to be high-quality, 
 but it should be good enough that you can understand what someone is saying.

  <p><em>Also, make sure you read the
    <a href="#preparation">Preparation</a> section below.</em> You will also receive some further 
   information before the workshop so please check your email.</p>

   All paricipants are also required to abide by
  Software Carpentry's <a href="{{site.swc_site}}/conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.

      <ul>
       <li> If you want to teach Software Carpentry, please submit a small pull request to
            <a href="{{page.prep-repository}}">this repository</a>
            Your pull request should contain one file (and one file only) called "your_name.txt" 
            (e.g., marie_curie.txt or alan_turing.txt). This file should contain a sentence or
